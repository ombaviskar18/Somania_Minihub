**How to add them in Vercel:**
1. In your project settings, go to "Environment Variables"
2. Add each variable with its value
3. Deploy again if needed

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Your app will be live at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
